# Terraformus
Terraformus is a terraforming simulator for Computer Graphics CS4361.
In it the user can add different elements and objects to a planet in order to terraform it into a habitable planet.

# Tech
This project is written using Unity6.

# TODO (functional minimum):
## Mouse Controls:
Allow the user to rotate the planet and zoom in/out for a better look.
The user will also need the ability to select an object from the UI and place it on the planet either through drag and drop or a select and click scheme.

## Terraforming Effects:
Each of the objects the user can put on the planet will have to effect the appearance of the planet in some way.

# TODO (additional features):
## UI:
### Start/Pause Screen
### Terraforming Progress
A way to determine how much of the planet has been terraformed.
### User Setting
Things like custom key binds. Typical settings found in games, audio levels, resolution.

## Additional Planets:
Add additional planets and sky boxes for some variety.
